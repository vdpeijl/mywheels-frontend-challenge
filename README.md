# MyWheels Frontend Challenge

## Development

- Install the dependencies: `yarn install`
- Run the development server: `yarn dev`
- Execute the tests: `yarn test`

## Assignment

Create a small application that displays a list of resources (cars) that are provided by the API. Use the `useApi` method provided in `src/api.js` to fetch the JSON containing the resources.

1. Display a list of resources, for each of the items in the list display at least the following information:

   - Brand
   - Model
   - Address
   - Fuel type
   - Availability
   - Rate per/hour

2. Add an input field that searches for specific resource models.
3. Create a way to filter the list on fuel type, availability, winter tires and towbar.
4. Show the number of found resources.

## Optional tasks

As a bonus one of the following additional features could be added to the application.

- Create automated tests for (a part) of the application.
- Add the option to toggle between a list view and a map view.
- Convert the code to use TypeScript
- Use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/) instead of the Webpack setup.
- Add a personal touch by styling the application.
- Pitch an idea for a great additional feature and show (in rough lines) how that could be implemented.
